Contributing a paper follows a fork-and-pull request workflow

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Clone your fork locally**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<contributor-username>/sdmx4ds.git
   cd sdmx4ds
3. **Create a new feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
4. **Make your changes in the documents/your-name/ folder.**
   ...
5. **Commit and push all changes to your fork.**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new document"
   git push origin feature-branch
6. **Open a pull request to main.**
	 On GitHub, go to “Pull requests” → “New pull request”.
   Select: Base repository: Your repo (your-org/your-repo), main branch.

Once the pull request (PR) has been created, your submission will undergo a review process.
