##  Introduction

This project explores the potential of SDMX as a backbone for data science workflows in official statistics, using EU energy, population and economic data as a concrete use case. It is structured around modular, purpose-driven notebooks built on reproducible, open-source tools.

## Why SDMX for data science?

The Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) standard provides APIs and metadata-rich formats that simplify access to official data. In this project, SDMX enables:
- **Tool reusability**: As an example, pysdmx can be used for dealing with any SDMX data source, regardless of the domain or geography (in this project, for instance, we get data from Eurostat and the ECB using the same tools and methods).
- **Reproducibility**: Anyone can run the notebooks and fetch the same data, from the original source, using the SDMX API.
- **Updateability**: Scripts can be rerun without code changes when new data are published.

Together, these features make SDMX an ideal fit for scalable, transparent data science.

## Project components

The project uses Python and the `pysdmx` package to handle SDMX data. Common logic is stored in the `utils/` folder, which provides reusable code for fetching, parsing and standardising SDMX datasets.

The main notebooks are:

- **`1. Metadata_research.ipynb`**: Investigates SDMX metadata to understand dimensions, codes, and data availability. This forms the foundation for working with Eurostat’s energy datasets.
- **`2. Energy_overview.ipynb`**: Loads key datasets via SDMX, providing an  overview of energy consumption across EU countries.
- **`3. Households_updated.ipynb`**: Focuses on household energy prices, analysing levels and trends, and highlighting cross-country differences.
- **`4. Impact_price_changes.ipynb`**: Explores the economic implications of energy price shocks, by analysing the cost of energy in terms of GDP.
- **`5. Renewables evolution.ipynb`**: Examines the growth of renewable energy in the EU and its relationship with CO2 emissions.

These notebooks are designed to be run independently or as part of a broader workflow. Each one uses consistent tooling and data structures, making them easy to extend or adapt.


## Installing the project

This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage packages. If you have pipenv installed, you just need to run `pipenv install` from the root folder.

## Conclusion

Using SDMX data made it possible to automate and standardise the analysis pipeline, improving both reproducibility and transparency. The approach and tools used here can be adapted for other SDMX datasets to support timely monitoring of economic indicators and inform evidence-based decision-making.
